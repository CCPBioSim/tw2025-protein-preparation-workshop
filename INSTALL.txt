Prerequisites:

1. Ambertools installed
2. Blastp installed, with Swissprot database

Requirements (will install other required Python packages):
git+https://github.com/CharlieLaughton/Alphacheck.git

HOWEVER:
With a bit of luck you may be able to boostrap a functional Jupyter notebook
from nothing by just running:

./run_notebook.sh
