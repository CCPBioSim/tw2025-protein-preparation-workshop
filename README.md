# Protein preparation workshop for Training Week 2025

This workshop walks through the process of preparing a simple protein system 
for molecular dynamics simulation using [Ambertools](https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php). In addition, it showcases the use of [Alphafix](https://github.com/CharlieLaughton/Alphafix) to remediate crystal structure-derived models (identify and rebuild missing atoms and residues).
