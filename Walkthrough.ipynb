    "# Preparing a protein for MD simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demo the use of a workflow based on **Ambertools** for the preparation of systems for MD simulation. **Amber** has a particularly rich eco system of utilities for this process, but other simulation packages have their own tools too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a couple of places you will also be using some 3rd party utilities (not part of **Ambertools**) to help. These come from a Python package called [Alphafix](https://github.com/CharlieLaughton/Alphafix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this workshop will be done on the CCP-BioSim Jupyter Hub, but you may also want to \n",
    "create a folder on your own laptop to store files you download for visualization with Chimera, PyMol, VMD, or any other graphics program you favour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although for convenience we are using a JupyterLab environment for this workshop, all the work is being done from **the command line** in a **terminal session** - we are not using notebooks to run any Python code - this window just provides the instructions on what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "For  this workshop we are imagining that we are interested in performing some MD simulations on the protein [MCl-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCL1) in the apo- form (i.e., without any other proteins or ligands bound to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Find a suitable starting structure in the Protein Data Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the PDB website: https://www.rcsb.org\n",
    "2. Type 'mcl-1' into the search box and press return\n",
    "You will get a list of over 200 different entries in the PDB. Deciding which of these can provide the best \"starting material\" for a simulation of Mcl-1 in the apo- (unliganded) form\n",
    "is beyond the scope of this workshop, but for no special reson we are going to use entry **5FDR** for this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Type '5fdr' into the search box on the PDB web page, and click on the same code in the pop-up that appears.\n",
    "6. Examine the entry. In particular, note the cartoon picture in the top left (titled 'Biological Assembly 1').\n",
    "7. Click on '<' or '>' to cycle through *three* other biological assemblies that are part of this PDB entry. They correspond to other molecules of the protein found in the unit cell of the crystal structure. You need to evaluate which of these is going to be the best to use as a start point for your model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Analyse and evaluate the PDB entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do this section in your Jupyter Lab environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have not already done so, open a terminal session in your lab environment, and check you are in the home folder for the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you type `ls` you will see the file `5fdr.pdb`. This has been downloaded from the PDB website for you. You will also see it in the file browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (Optional) Out of curiosity, take a look at the contents of this file. You have some options here:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Use the unix `less` command in your terminal window.\n",
    "    2. Double-click on the file name in the browser window to open it as a tab in your Jupyter session.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to establish which of the four biological assemblies in this PDB entry is going to be the best starting point for your model building. Protein structures in PDB entries are often incomplete. Atoms - sometimes entire amino acids - can be missing because they could not be resolved. You need to check the completeness of each assembly in the entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the terminal window, type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alpha_check -i 5fdr.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `alpha_check` utility finds the [UnitProt accession number](https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers) corresponding to the sequence in each *chain* (biological assembly), then finds the predicted 3D structure for this ID in the [Alphafold structure database](https://alphafold.com/). It then compares the crystal structure with the alphafold model, and reports on the differences.\n",
    "   \n",
    "       \n",
    "5. Decide which of the four copies of the protein in the crystal structure seems most complete.\n",
    "   We would suggest this is probably chain A - do you agree?\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Remediate the chain A structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use residues and atoms from the alphafold model to fill in any \"gaps\" in the crystal structure-derived data. \n",
    "1. Use the \"alpha_fix\" utility\n",
    "   for this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "       alpha_fix -i 5fdr.pdb -c A -o 5fdr_A_fixed.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Confirm that missing atoms and residues have now been inserted:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "       alpha_check -i 5fdr_A_fixed.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. (Optional) Download a copy of both 5fdr.pdb and the remediated structure **to your laptop** and open then in *Chimera* or other graphics program. Focussing on chain A, examine some of the residues that needed remediation. Does `alpha_fix` appear to have done a reasonable job?\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Prepare the remediated structure for simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Back in your Jupyter Lab environment now**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The remediated structure is complete at the heavy-atom level, but contains no hydrogen atoms.\n",
    "   These cannot be added until the tautomeric state of histidine residues has been chosen.\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Use the **AmberTools** `pdb4amber` tool to analyse the protein structure, and which tautomeric form\n",
    "   is most likely for each histidine (based on the pattern of hydrogen-bonding interactions it\n",
    "   generates). Use the `--reduce` option to do this. In addition use the `-p` option to process only protein residues in the structure ( i.e., remove the ligand and so generate the apo- form):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "       pdb4amber -i 5fdr_A_fixed.pdb --reduce -p -o 5fdr_A_prepared.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. A number of output files are produced in addition to `5fdr_A_prepared.pdb` but we will not discuss them here.\n",
    "3. Open `5fdr_A_prepared.pdb` in a text editor (or use `less`) and see how the structure now also contains hydrogen atoms, and the histidine residues, that used to have the residue name \"HIS\", are now named \"HID\" or \"HIE\" depending on which tautomer has been predicted as more likely in each environment.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Download the structure to your laptop and view to confirm this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Generate the required input files for AMBER MD simulation from the prepared protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This final stage involves adding all remaining components of the simulation system\n",
    "   (The solvent and maybe ions to represent the aqueous environment), and\n",
    "   generating the two files that **AMBER** simulations require: one with the coordinates of the \n",
    "   system, the other with required topological and forcefield data.\n",
    "1. Decide on details of the simulation system to be constructed. In particular, how will the\n",
    "   aqueous environment be represented. Most usually the protein will be modelled in a periodic\n",
    "   box of water molecules. The size and type of periodic box must be decided. It must be decided\n",
    "   if it's also necessary to add a certain concentration of inorganic salt (typically NaCl) to\n",
    "   mimic a physiological environment.\n",
    "   Then the forcefields to use for the simulation must be chosen.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Here we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Use a truncated octahedral box of water that extends at least 12 Angstroms beyond any protein atom.\n",
    "    2.  Add enough salt (Na+ and Cl- ions) to ensure the final system is electrically neutral and has a ion molarity of about 0.15M.\n",
    "    3.  Use the FF19SB forcefield for the protein, and OPC model for the water.\n",
    "This step is performed using the **Ambertools** `tleap` tool, but writing the required input file for `tleap` can be a little involved, especially if a particular ion molarity is desired, so we will use a little python script -  `make_leap.py` to simplify the process:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "       ./make_leap.py --inpdb 5fdr_A_prepared.pdb  --outinpcrd 5fdr_A.inpcrd \\\n",
    "           --outprmtop 5fdr_A.prmtop --solvate oct \\\n",
    "           --forcefields protein.ff19SB --padding 12.0 \\\n",
    "           --ion_molarity 0.15 > tleap.in\n",
    "\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Take a look at the file `tleap.in` that has been generated. You will see iot is not that difficult to understand, and indeed could be written from scratch by hand, but the sums to calculate the numbers of sodium and chloride ions to add could have been awkward.\n",
    "5. Now you can use the **Ambertools** `tleap` tool to process this script and create the *coordinate* and *topology* files that are required for MD simulations using **Amber**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "        tleap -f tleap.in\n",
    "\n",
    "```  \n",
    "The program produces voluminous output - do take the time to look through it and understand what `tleap` did. The output may contain warning messages, but these are OK - but any **Error** messages are not!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For visualization purposes, create a PDB format file for the completed system from the \n",
    "   AMBER-format files generated in the last step. The **Ambertools** `ambpdb` tool does this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "       ambpdb -p 5fdr_A.prmtop < 5fdr_A.inpcrd > 5fdr_A_amber.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Download this file **to your laptop** and take a look in *Chimera*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## All done!\n",
    "\n",
    "With the files `5fdr_A.inpcrd` and `5fdr_A.prmtop` prepared, you are ready to start running MD simulations. It's generally possible to convert these files into alternative formats, so you can run your systems with **Gromacs** or **OpenMM** for example, not just **Amber**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook has illustrated the basic steps involved in preparing a simple protein system for MD simulation with **AMBER**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an approriate starting structure - probably from the PDB.\n",
    "2. *Caveat emptor*! Be aware this structure may well need remediation before it can be used. Here you used `alpha_check` and `alpha_fix` to help with this.\n",
    "3. Add hydrogen atoms to the protein - a non-trivial process if amino acids with alternative tautomeric or protonation states are present. Here you used `pdb4amber` to help with this.\n",
    "4. Complete the simulation system by adding solvent and ions, and generate the structure and parameter/topology files that **AMBER** requires as input. You used `tleap` for this, but also a home-grown Python script `make_leap.py`, to ease the process.\n"
